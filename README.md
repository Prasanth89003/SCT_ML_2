Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering to group customers of a retail store based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset used contains information such as Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score of customers.

Dataset:
The dataset used is Mall_Customers.csv, which includes:
Customer ID – Unique identifier for each customer
Gender – Male/Female
Age – Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$) – Yearly income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100) – A measure of how much they spend at the store

Implementation Steps:
Load and explore the dataset
Perform data visualization and preprocessing
Use Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
Apply K-Means Clustering
Visualize the clustered customer groups

Results & Visualizations
The results include:
✅ A scatter plot to visualize customer segments
✅ A WCSS (Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares) plot to determine optimal K
✅ A clear distinction of customer groups based on spending habits

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
